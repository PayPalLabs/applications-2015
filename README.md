Thank you for applying with us.

Before you come down for the interview, we’d like you to complete a simple API exercise. We will use this as a base for the interview sessions, so if you cannot complete it at least 1 day before the interview please email below to reschedule.

Using the technologies, frameworks and/or programming languages of your choice; create a website that allows a user to purchase a product using PayPal’s Express Checkout (on the sandbox environment)

Don’t worry about aesthetics. It doesn’t need to look pretty, and it doesn’t need to be complex.

Focus on the basic functionality first. Anything extra you want to add is a bonus.

I will need the following deliverables from you:

1. A URL where I can try your integration (you must only use free resources for this. I leave it up to you to choose whatever you’re comfortable with)
2. The source code for your integration (bitbucket, sourceforge, github, etc)
3. A written explanation of your work (part of the README with your source code)

All deliverables must be sent to aljiang@paypal.com at least 1 day before your interview – you will receive a reply to confirm your interview.

If you have any questions please email the address above.

Thank you!
Alvin
